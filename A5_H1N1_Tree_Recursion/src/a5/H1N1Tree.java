/** Important notes 1. Remember that a variable declared as: H1N1Tree ct; <br>
 * can be viewed in two ways. (1) It is a node of a tree (2) It is the whole tree! <br>
 * More specifically, the root of the tree.
 *
 * At any point, we may talk about "node ct" or "tree ct" or "the tree with root ct". <br>
 * It all depends on what is important at this point.
 *
 * 2. For this particular class and assignment, we also use the following terminology. <br>
 * Let p be a Person. When we talk of
 *
 * . . . . "H1N1Tree p",
 *
 * we mean the H1N1Tree node that has p in field person. <br>
 * This saves a lot of verbiage; it shortens explanations and specs. <br>
 * It's OK to use this abbreviation because, in this project, no Person <br>
 * can appear more than once in a H1N1Tree.
 *
 * An instance of H1N1Tree represents the spread of H1N1 among a Network of people. <br>
 * In this model, each person can "catch" H1N1 from only a single person. <br>
 * The root of the H1N1Tree is the person who first got H1N1. <br>
 * From there, each person in the H1N1Tree is the child of the person who gave <br>
 * them H1N1. For example, for the tree:
 *
 * <pre>
 *       A
 *      / \
 *     B   C
 *        / \
 *       D   E
 * </pre>
 *
 * Person A originally got H1N1, B and C caught H1N1 from A, and<br>
 * D and E caught H1N1 from C.
 *
 * Important note: Each person in the H1N1 tree is unique. <br>
 * Check whether two Person's are the same by calling method equals. */
